# User Manual

the following are suggestions, as either variant of the app can be used for any scenario,

## For Apple TV/Classroom use

When you launch the page you are met with the start page. Here, you can enter a name, if you are using this for a class, you can put the name of the class here, decide a name yourself, or have the class decide a name

Next, you will have the option between 12 different subjects, each of these contain a brief introductory discussion, and then an activity, followed usually by more discussion points. 

Each of the sub-pages in the searching section contain a QR code which redirect to a game sheet. clicking the qr code with the remote will randomise the QR code. 

Computer architecture and Image representation pages require a connected iOS device to access their interactive elements. 

You might find creating graphs and state machines in their respective pages sluggish, as you can only move things incrementally with the buttons provided. This, unfortunately was the only option for tvOS, but is not the case for iPad.

## For iPad/Individual use

When you launch the page you are met with the start page. Here, you can enter your name. Leaving this blank will use the name of your device instead.

The searching pages require 2 players. For the last game, hashing, only works if **only one person selects each player**. i.e. one for player 1, one for player 2. 

Computer architecture can work either connected or disconnected from an apple tv. If you connect, your device will be shown as a numbered core on the tv, and once you complete the activity, this core will be outlined in green both in your version and on the tv. 

Image representation works similarly. It can be used with or without an apple tv. If you connect, your drawing canvas will be shown on the apple tv, this time with your name under it. It will start showing once you start drawing, and update in real time.
